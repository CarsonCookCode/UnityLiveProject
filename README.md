# Unity Live Project - Code Summary
## Introduction
I worked in an Agile/Scrum environment to build a classic arcade game in Unity using C#. I chose the game DigDug and attempted to replicated the feel and playability of the first level as much as possible with the time that I had. We used Azure DevOps to manage our repositories and user stories.

Here are some of the highlights from the project:


## Story 1: Creating the Basic Scenes


## Story 2: Level Design and Player Behavior


## Story 3: Opposition Behavior


## Story 4: Complete Gameplay Model


## Story 5: Final Touches
