# Unity Live Project - Code Summary
## Introduction
I worked in an Agile/Scrum environment to build a classic arcade game in Unity using C#. I chose the game DigDug and attempted to replicated the feel and playability of the first level as much as possible with the time that I had. We used Azure DevOps to manage our repositories and user stories. I developed a productive workflow after familiarizing myself with the tools at my disposal. Over the two week sprint I had many opportunities to learn what it means to work as part of a team on a single project.

Here are some of the highlights from the project:


## Story 1: Creating the Basic Scenes

For my first user story I needed to set up the basic scenes. I set up the SceneLoader and then using TileMaps set up the first level with the sprites that I found.
